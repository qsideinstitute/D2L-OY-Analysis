# DATA2LIFT Opportunity Youth Analysis
This repo is a shared space for data analysis and visualization tools related to opportunity youth. This repo is a part of QSIDE's [DATA2LIFT initiative.](http://qsideinstitute.org/data2lift/) 

## Current Action Items (Due Tues. April 9th, 2024):
1. Create a contingency table containing chi-squared test results for sex/race/age in the individual-level foster care dataset. [Here](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/chi-square-test-in-python-a-technical-guide/) is an example guide.
2. Create a figure showing the sex breakdown by race. This figure should have 9 columns of equal width (one column for each race/ethnicity category and one for the whole population). columns should all be the same height, with male + female categories adding up to 100\%.
3. Add reproducible code to this repo.
  - Code should be commented well enough for another team member to understand.
  - Code should be written so that changes are possible, especially to the plot style.
